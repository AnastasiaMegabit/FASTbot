# Welcome to FASTbot ![https://1712507217.rsc.cdn77.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/medical-robot.jpg](src)

## Objective 

We wanted to design a bot that would receive requests from a dispatcher to autonomously pick up and deliver supplies to specific spots over an unpredictable, rough terrain by using dynamic and simultaneous localization and mapping.  AR Markers were meant to represent pick up and drop off locations,  to later be replaced with color block recognition for locating pick ups at the Red Cross tent and facial recognition to locate particular people in the field for delivery.  In this type of emergency environment, we expected the bot to be able to identify and navigate to a specified destination while dynamically avoiding static or dynamic obstacles. 


## Motivation

From a learning standpoint, the project utilizes concepts such as SLAM and AR-Tag recognition which we have been exposed to in EE106A while also allowing us to work with newer concepts such as feedback and obstacle avoidance.
In labs, we have seen concepts quantized as weekly packets of different ideas and utilities offered by ROS. We think it would be interesting to see how can these concepts be integrated to achieve a single goal of carrying a first aid box from and to a specific destination with the help of a turtlebot who has a certain degree of autonomy. 
From a more general standpoint, there has been a lot of effort being invested into creating bots that relieve some stress imposed on search and rescue teams and triage nurses in field hospitals. More generally, there is always going to be a need to develop technology that allows for accessibility, portability and some level of autonomy in the healthcare or disaster management sector. Our project will allow us to get a taste of the challenges and design decisions required to fulfill the goal of the carrier bot to deliver first aid kits in unpredictable and rough terrain.
