### Welcome to FASTbot

## Objective 

We wanted to design a bot that would receive requests from a dispatcher to autonomously pick up and deliver supplies to specific spots over an unpredictable, rough terrain by using dynamic and simultaneous localization and mapping.  AR Markers were meant to represent pick up and drop off locations,  to later be replaced with color block recognition for locating pick ups at the Red Cross tent and facial recognition to locate particular people in the field for delivery.  In this type of emergency environment, we expected the bot to be able to identify and navigate to a specified destination while dynamically avoiding static or dynamic obstacles.
